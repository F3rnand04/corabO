# Functional Status Report of the Corabo Application

**Date:** July 23, 2025
**Version:** 1.0.0 (Stable and Operational)
**Objective:** To document the components and workflows that have been implemented, validated, and are functioning correctly after the transition from a simulated state to a real, working implementation.

---

## 1. Core Architecture and Data Flow

The application's core now operates on a robust and decoupled architecture, ensuring security and performance.

-   **Unidirectional Flow:** Communication follows a strict pattern: `UI Component (Client)` -> `Server Action` -> `Genkit Flow (Server)` -> `Database (Firestore)`.
-   **Client/Server Separation:** The `UnhandledSchemeError` has been completely eradicated. All modules using backend logic (like `firebase-admin` or `genkit`) are correctly isolated on the server using the `'use server';` directive.
-   **Reactive State Management:** `AuthProvider` efficiently manages the client's state, subscribing to real-time data from Firestore once the user is authenticated.

## 2. Authentication and User Module

The complete user lifecycle is functional and secure.

-   **Real Login:**
    -   **Google:** Authentication with Google is fully implemented via Firebase Authentication.
    -   **Guest:** Guest login generates a valid temporary user, allowing exploration of the platform.
-   **Session Management:** User sessions are persistent and secure, managed through server-side session cookies.
-   **Registration and Initial Setup:** The flow guiding a new user to complete their basic data (`/initial-setup`) is fully functional and saves the information to Firestore.
-   **Provider Profile Creation:** The flows for a user to become a "Provider" (both personal and company) are implemented and work correctly, updating the user type and enabling advanced features.

**Status:** <span style="color:green;">**OPERATIONAL**</span>

## 3. Profiles and Gallery Module

The display and management of users' public identity are complete.

-   **Public Profile View:** Any user can view another's profile, displaying their public information, reputation, statistics, and content.
-   **Publications Gallery:** Providers can create, edit, and delete publications (images and videos) in their gallery. File uploads to Firebase Storage are functional.
-   **Product Catalog:** Providers can create and display products in a dedicated tab on their profile, including name, description, price, and image.

**Status:** <span style="color:green;">**OPERATIONAL**</span>

## 4. Transactions and Payments Module

The financial heart of Corabo is working.

-   **Transaction Log:** The system creates and updates transactions for a variety of flows:
    -   Quote creation.
    -   Acceptance of agreement proposals.
    -   Purchases from the catalog.
    -   Payments for campaigns and subscriptions.
-   **Payment with Voucher Flow:** The process where a user makes a payment and uploads a voucher (`/payment`) is fully functional. The image is converted to a `dataUrl` and prepared for storage.
-   **QR Code Payment:**
    -   **Provider:** Can display a unique QR code for their profile or a specific "cashier box."
    -   **Client:** Can scan the QR to initiate a direct payment, entering the amount requested by the provider in real-time.
-   **Credicora:** The credit level system is defined and assigned to users, though the specific financing flows are in an initial stage.

**Status:** <span style="color:green;">**OPERATIONAL**</span>

---

## 5. Messaging and Proposals Module

Direct communication between users is functional and in real-time.

-   **Real-Time Chat:** Users can start conversations and send text messages. The chat interface updates instantly with new messages.
-   **Proposal System:** Providers can send formal "Agreement Proposals" via chat, specifying details and amounts. Clients can accept these proposals, which automatically generates a formal transaction in the system.

**Status:** <span style="color:green;">**OPERATIONAL**</span>

---

## 6. Administration Module

Tools for platform management are implemented.

-   **User Management:** Administrators can view, pause, reactivate, and delete users.
-   **Payment Verification:** Payments for subscriptions and campaigns appear on the panel for an administrator to verify and activate the corresponding services.
-   **Document Verification:** The interface for reviewing identity documents is ready, allowing an administrator to approve or reject a user's verification.

**Status:** <span style="color:green;">**OPERATIONAL**</span>

---

## 7. Artificial Intelligence Module (Genkit)

The foundation for AI functionalities is active and ready for use.

-   **Google AI Plugin:** The plugin is correctly configured and enabled.
-   **Document Verification Flow:** The `autoVerifyIdWithAIFlow` is implemented. It can receive a document image and, using a multimodal model, attempt to extract and compare the data with the user's record.

**Status:** <span style="color:green;">**OPERATIONAL AND READY TO USE**</span>

## General Conclusion

The Corabo application has successfully moved past the simulation phase. The architecture is stable, data flows are secure, and the main functionalities are implemented and operational. The project is ready for the next phase of development, which could include feature expansion, large-scale user testing, and performance optimizations.
