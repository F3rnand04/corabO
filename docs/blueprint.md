## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light desaturated blue (#B0D8FF) for trust and clarity, appropriate for a service-based application. This blue evokes calm, professionalism, and reliability, which is crucial for a transactional application.
- Background color: Very light desaturated blue (#F0F8FF) which complements the primary blue.
- Accent color: Pale desaturated violet (#D8B0FF) for interactive elements and highlights, contrasting subtly with the blue.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, providing a clean and modern look suitable for both headlines and body text.  This selection is a good all-arounder, since it will be used in most of the interface and for both headlines and body text.
- Use Lucide React for a consistent and modern icon set.
- Clean and intuitive design with a focus on user-centered navigation. Use of cards to group related information, with consistent spacing and alignment.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience, such as smooth loading indicators and feedback animations for user actions.
